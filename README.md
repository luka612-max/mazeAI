# mazeAI

## 🤖 AI-Powered Maze Solver & Generator

This project is a Python-based application that focuses on generating mazes and implementing Artificial Intelligence or algorithmic solutions to navigate and solve them. It provides a visual and interactive environment for observing common pathfinding algorithms in action.



## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Maze Generation:** Implements an algorithm (e.g., Randomized Prim's or Recursive Backtracker) to generate unique, solvable mazes.
* **AI Pathfinding:** Uses classic search algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, or A\*) to find the shortest or optimal path from start to finish.
* **Visual Representation:** Renders the maze, the search process, and the final solution path using graphical assets (`wall.png`, `pathimg.png`).
* **Background Audio:** Includes ambient background sound for an enhanced user experience (`background.wav`).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have **Python 3.x** installed.

It is highly likely that a library for graphics and game development, such as **Pygame**, is required, given the file types.

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Pygame** (or similar library)

### Installing Dependencies

If your system uses a library like Pygame, you can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame
# You might need to add other dependencies if the project uses them
